              <h4>Kaleigh says:</h4>
              <p>I was roommates at GA Southern with Shaun's brother Bill for 2 years. I met Bill because we were both music majors (I was at first anyways). A year into living with him, Shaun finally came to visit GSU. When Shaun was staying with us for his freshman orientation, I remember having fun &amp; joking around with him from the second he walked in the door.</p>
              <p>Shaun would always come over his 1st semester and hang out. But when his brother left to student teach after that semester, and I wasn't seeing Shaun as much, I realized I missed seeing him. Luckily I learned Shaun could fix up bikes and I would make sure to always find something wrong with mine, so he could fix it. I was always excited when we randomly saw each other on campus and at parties at our friend Lainey's apartment.</p>
              <p>The semester ended, and I went off to London for the summer. I think this is when our epic Facebook Poke war began. I even found myself trying to figure out if I should bring back a present for him. I settled on chocolate, which was a great choice.</p>
              <p>When I returned from London, Shaun and I started texting a lot more. About a week later was Bill's birthday and everyone was going out...including Shaun! I was excited to finally see him since spring semester ended. Shaun snuck into the bar (21+) and we talked all night. I remember texting Shaun afterwards saying we need to start hanging out on a regular basis once we got back to school.</p>
              <p>Finally move in day came, and we both were back at GSU. Once we had both moved into our apartments, we went on a super hot date to <strong>the Walmart</strong>. Which in Statesboro, is the place to see and be seen. Especially on move in day, because literally everyone and their mom is there.</p>
              <p>A couple of weeks later, Shaun and I basically told each other that we wanted to start dating each other. On a beautiful beach in the moonlight. By beach I mean sand volleyball court at my apartment, and moonlight I mean street lamps. We sat there and talked for hours about random things and Shaun serenaded me to Jason Mraz.</p>
              <p>Since then we always found excuses to be together.</p>
